# UI Components

## Primary Rule
- Prefer existing shadcn/ui components from `@/components/ui/*` whenever possible.

## Before Creating a New UI Primitive
- Check whether the component already exists under `src/components/ui`.
- Check the shadcn component catalog: `https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components`.
- If it does not exist locally but exists in shadcn, install/add that component first.

## Avoid
- Duplicating primitives already covered by shadcn/ui (buttons, dialogs, tabs, selects, etc.).
- Creating one-off variants that should be shared under `src/components/ui`.
